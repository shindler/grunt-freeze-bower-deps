This task freezes front-end dependencies to be independent of bower/github etc.... but what does this mean?

- it scans bower output directory for downloaded dependencies
- then it compares version of downloaded dependencies vs already frozen dependencies
- if an already frozen version of given dependency is found it prompts to confirm the update
- if `keepVendorsFolderOnUpdate` is set to false it removes given dependency folder
- then all files defined as `main` in bower.json (-exclude(d)Files, +include(d)Files) are copied to `vendorsFolder` to be frozen inside project git repo
